## Mission 🚀
To provide a structured and progressive set of exercises as a course or tutorial aimed towards teaching and learning datatable for beginners, intermediates as well as experts.

Python's [datatable](https://github.com/h2oai/datatable) package that is synonymous with R's [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) library can be used for various kinds of data processing, feature engineering and modelling tasks as part of data science pipelines.

## Exercises 📖
There are a total of 100 exercises divided into 10 sets of 10 exercises each.

✅ Jupyter Notebooks without solutions for exploring & attempting   
✅ Jupyter Notebooks with solutions for teaching & learning   
✅ Level-wise sets based on chronological topics   
✅ Available on Colab, Kaggle, Binder & GitHub   

The exercises are best experienced using datatable's [v1.0.0](https://datatable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/v1.0.0.html) (Released on 1st July, 2021) & above but recommended to use the latest available version.
